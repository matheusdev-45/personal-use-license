# Personal Use License (PUL)

This repository defines the **Personal Use License (PUL)** — a custom software license created by Matheus Campos.

## License Summary

- 📌 **Allowed:** Use the software for **personal or private purposes only**.  
- ❗ **Prohibited:** Distribution, sale, public sharing, sublicensing, or any form of commercial use.  
- ⚠️ The software is provided **“as is”**, without any warranty or liability on the author’s part.

## Note

Because PUL prohibits redistribution and commercial use, software licensed under PUL is **not open source** — it is more similar to a **proprietary license with personal‑use‑only restrictions**.
